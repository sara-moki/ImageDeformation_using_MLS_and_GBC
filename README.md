---

These are graphical user interface (GUI) tools for image deformation using moving least squares (MLS) and generalized barycentric coordinates (GBC), specifically, Wachspress and mean-value coordinates.

Please read the README.md files provided in each folder for each tool.
- Point-based image deformation.
- Curve-based image deformation.
- Region-based image deformation.
- Image deformation using barycentric mapping.
