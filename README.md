---

These are graphical user interface (GUI) tools for image deformation using moving least squares (MLS) and generalized barycentric coordinates (GBC), namely, Wachspress and mean-value coordinates.*
- Point-based image deformation.
- Curve-based image deformation.
- Region-based image deformation.
- Image deformation using barycentric mapping. 

### Please check README.md files for each tool that are provided in each folder.
