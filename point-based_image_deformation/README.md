# Point-based Image Deformation
This is a graphical user interface tool for implementing *point-based image deformation using moving least squares*
---
To use this tool, a user can select whether to execute deformation on a grid or an image, where the
resolution or the grid size can be adjusted. 
- Before pressing on *Add Polygon*, select the type of coordinates (WC for convex regions only).
- To place the intersection-free handles, for every handle, place the vertices first by left-clicking and then finish by right-clicking.
- After placing all the handles, press *Deform*.
- To excute the deformation, one can place the cursor on polgon’s vertices and drag them while left-clicking.
