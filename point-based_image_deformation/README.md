# Point-based Image Deformation
This is a graphical user interface tool for implementing *point-based image deformation using moving least squares*
---
To use this tool, a user can select whether to execute deformation on a curve, a grid or an image, where the resolution or the corse grid size can be adjusted to reduce the number of pixels of the chosen grid or image. 
- To add the control points (handles), press *select markers*, and then place them by left-clicking and then finish by right-clicking.
- After placing all the handles, the user may select the deformation class (affine, similarity or rigid), then press * Interactive Deformation*.
- To excute the deformation, one can place the cursor on the handle and move them while left-clicking. 
- In the deformation mode, one can switch between deformation classes, as well as modify the scale parameter (*alpha*). 
- To save the outcome, click *Save*, and to start a new application, left-click twice then press *Reset* button.
