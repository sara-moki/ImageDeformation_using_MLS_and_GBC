This tool was created by Sara Alkiswani last modified May-2021. 
A user can select whether to execute deformation on a grid or an image, where the resolution can be adjusted and the coarse grid is an approximation of the chosen grid or image. For each star-shape handle, before pressing on {\it Add Handle}, one can change the number of Legendre points in the parameterization, select the type of coordinates (\gls{WC} for convex regions only), and the handle's color. To place the intersection-free handles, for every handle, place the vertices first by left-clicking and then right-clicking when finished. After placing all the handles, the user may select the deformation class (affine, similar or rigid), and the deformation map whether it is translating the entire region ({\it Translation}), or deforming the handle ({\it Deformation}), then press {\it Deform}. If the map chosen is {\it Deformation}, one can place the cursor on handle's vertices and drag them while left-clicking, and if the map is ({\it Translation}), then click on the center of the handle and translate it, resulting in the deformed grid or image. In the deformation mode, one can switch between deformation classes and mapping, as well as modify the scale parameter. 
To save the outcome, click {\it Save}, and to start a new application, left-click twice then press on {\it Reset} button.
